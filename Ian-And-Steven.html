    <h1>Portland's Cutest Couple</h1>
    <h2>and beyond</h2>

    <p>There once was a couple of queers in portland who where lucky enough to meet eachother on September 12, 2018.</p>
    <p>On their first date they went to a cafe and skipped rocks into the Willamette River.</p>
    <p>A copule dates later they rode the sky tram at sunset before getting sushi.</p>
    <p>Every day and every date since then has been just as magical and romantic as the first dates they went on.</p>
    <p>Here are some things that Ian loves about Steven:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how sweet and caring Steven is to Ian</li>
        <li>how much Steven cares about his friends and loved ones (hazel)</li>
        <li>Steven's belly</li>
        <li>Steven's beautiful face when he wakes up in the morning</li>
        <li>cuddling.</li>
        <li>Steven's love of good food</li>
        <li>how Ian and Steven get to make art together</li>
        <li>how much Steven loves Ian</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I couldn't figure out how to attach an acutal picture of Ian and Steven from the internet, but this picture of a Cat and a Dog loving eachother is pretty much close enough.</p>
